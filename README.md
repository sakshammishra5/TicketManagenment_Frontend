# Authentication System - Login & Signup

This project includes a simple authentication system with predefined login credentials and a signup flow where the user's **firstname becomes the username**.

---

## 🔐 Default Login Credentials

Use the following credentials to log in as a test user:

- **Username:** `saksham`
- **Password:** `123`

## 📝 Signup Behavior

When a new user signs up:

- The **firstname** entered during registration will automatically be used as their **username**.
- The user must create a password during signup.
- After signup, the user can log in using:

  - **Username:** `firstname entered`
  - **Password:** `password created`

## 📌 Example

If a user signs up with:

- **Firstname:** `Rahul`
- **Password:** `rahul@123`

Their login credentials will be:

- **Username:** `Rahul`
- **Password:** `rahul@123`
